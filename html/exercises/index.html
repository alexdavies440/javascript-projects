      I think it would be cool to make a website that creates madlibs or produces some kind of humor using user input and Math.random. 
      Maybe I could give it a dicionary and it could go through every word in there and based on some grammar rules, come up with silly stories.
      I wonder if this is how early AI models were built. I feel like with enough random outputs and enough time and resources,
      it could write something really funny</p>
